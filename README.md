# wasm-malloc

A simple implementation of malloc/free for WebAssembly. The heap is a doubly linked lists, with blocks being merged or split if necessary/possible.

At the moment, realloc is not supported. malloc/calloc do not correctly align the memory.

Because the WebAssembly MVP does not support shrinking the linear memory, freed memory can not be released.

## Building

This requires llvm (compiled with the wasm32 target, see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/yurydelendik/4eeff8248aeb14ce763e)), wabt and binaryen. The llvm, wabt and binaryen must be accessible through the path.

```
mkdir build
CFLAGS=-O2 ./compile build/main.wasm src/mm.c src/main.c
```

Debugging information can be enabled with the preprocessor macro `MM_DEBUG`. This also adds the function `print_heap()` which prints the current layout of the heap to the browser console.

## Usage

The functions can be invoked in JavaScript as `instance.exports.malloc()/calloc()/free()`.

In C these functions can be included with `mm.h`, they have the exact same signature as in the C standard library.
